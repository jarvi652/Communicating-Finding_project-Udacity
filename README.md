Bike-Sharing Data Analysis
**Project Overview**
This project analyzes a dataset containing information about bike-sharing trips. The goal is to gain insights into user behavior, trip patterns, and the impact of various factors on bike-sharing usage.
**Data Structure**
The dataset includes the following columns:
`duration_sec`: Trip duration in seconds.
`start_time`, `end_time`: Date and time of trip start and end.
`start_station_id`, `start_station_name`, `start_station_latitude`, `start_station_longitude`: Information about the starting station.
`end_station_id`, `end_station_name`, `end_station_latitude`, end_station_longitude: Information about the ending station.
`bike_id`: Unique identifier for the bike.
`user_type`: Customer or Subscriber.
`member_birth_year`: Year of birth of the member.
`member_gender`: Gender of the member.
`bike_share_for_all_trip`: Whether the trip was part of a bike-share-for-all program.
**Analysis Goals:**
* Understand user behavior: Analyze how user types (Customers vs. Subscribers) differ in their usage patterns.
* Identify peak usage times: Determine the busiest times of the day and week for bike-sharing.
* Analyze trip duration: Investigate the distribution of trip durations and identify factors influencing trip length.
* Explore geographic patterns: Analyze the distribution of bike stations and popular routes.
* Identify trends and anomalies: Detect any unusual patterns or trends in the data.
By analyzing this dataset, we can gain valuable insights into the factors influencing bike-sharing usage and identify opportunities for improving the service.
